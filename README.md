Mostly look at URL Reader and Matrice 

URL Reader does all of the text scrapping 

The matrice creates and fills the matrice and the .csv file 

first60, prints the first 60 words of each article out, however this can be changed easily

compareList - compares two lists of words and their frequencies as maps

homogenityChiSQuare creates lists fit for doing a chisquare test
